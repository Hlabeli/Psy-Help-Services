# PsyHelp Mobile Application
The mobile application would be the platform were students could easily book and view appointments with either of the PsyCAD teams. They would also refer to the app to view the details of PsyCAD hosted events coming up as well as relevant articles and resources of interest.

The main objective of PsyHelp is to ensure that students can easily make bookings and view their appointments with the psychology or counselling team at the Centre for PsyCaD. PsyHelp will have an announcement feature so that students can view upcoming events hosted by the Centre for PsyCaD. PsyCaD will be as secure as pos-
sible, it must conform to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security standards to achieve this. NIST security standards are standards based on best practices from several security documents, organizations, and publications. They are designed as a framework for federal agencies and programs requiring stringent security measures. Therefore, it is fitting to apply these security standards to PsyHelp to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems. 

## The three most critical standards that PsyHelp must conform to are outlined below:
1. Use of strong passwords to log onto the system.
1. Encryption of data at rest.
1. Transmission of information through secure channels (HTTPS).
