# PsyHelp Mobile Application
The mobile application would be the platform were students could easily book and view appointments with either of the PsyCAD teams. They would also refer to the app to view the details of PsyCAD hosted events coming up as well as relevant articles and resources of interest.

The main objective of PsyHelp is to ensure that students can easily make bookings and view their appointments with the psychology or counselling team at the Centre for PsyCaD. PsyHelp will have an announcement feature so that students can view upcoming events hosted by the Centre for PsyCaD. PsyCaD will be as secure as pos-
sible, it must conform to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security standards to achieve this. NIST security standards are standards based on best practices from several security documents, organizations, and publications. They are designed as a framework for federal agencies and programs requiring stringent security measures. Therefore, it is fitting to apply these security standards to PsyHelp to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems. 

## The three most critical standards that PsyHelp must conform to are outlined below:
1. Use of strong passwords to log onto the system.
1. Encryption of data at rest.
1. Transmission of information through secure channels (HTTPS).

### Functional Requirements
The following are services which PsyHelp provides to solve the manual processes for booking services at the center for PsyCaD. These are functions and facilities re- quired by students.

- PsyHelp should provide user-friendly interface.
  - Students should be able to book appointments anytime and anywhere.
  - Appointments cancelation.
  - Viewing of Appointments, announcements and psychology tutorials.
  - User details update.

### The high level architecture of the application.

## Problem
At the University of Johannesburg, many students are not aware of services provided by the Centre for PsyCaD and that students often struggle to make appointments for counselling. The lack of PsyCaD awareness among students often results in less attendance of counselling sessions hosted by PsyCaD, which leads to a waste of Psy-
CaD time and resources. Therefore, PsyCaD needs a mobile application to allow UJ students to make bookings and view their appointments with counselling or psychological staff within the Centre for PsyCaD. The Centre does not have an application where students can learn about different approaches to overcoming depression and
anxiety; hence, this leads to many dropouts or underperforming students and students
committing suicide. However, having an awareness platform will reduce the rate of
depression and anxiety.

PsyCaD counselling appointments are manual because bookings are made through phone calls or email. As a result, time is wasted because the PsyCaD team has to capture student details and appointment dates, which is time-consuming to record and monitor the appointments attendance of students. Due to a manual process for
booking, it is difficult for PsyCaD to register students who attend the appointment and
those who did not participate because some PsyCaD staff could forget to capture the
figures of the day. Therefore, this results in errors in analyzing data for students who
attended and cancelled appointments. Thus, the management will get an inaccurate
report from the Centre of PsyCaD.
